# PRD: Minimal Habit Tracker App

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Stack:** TanStack (Router, Query, Table, Form) · React · TypeScript  
**Integration Demos:** Cloud Agents · OpenAPI Spec · Linear



## Overview

A full-stack Habit Tracker web application built on TanStack as a live showcase of Cloud Agents operating in the background — automatically generating OpenAPI specs from code and syncing tasks/issues to Linear.



## Goals

1. Deliver a production-quality Habit Tracker with clean UX.
2. Demonstrate Cloud Agents autonomously handling dev workflows (spec generation, issue creation, PR summaries).
3. Provide a reusable reference architecture for AI-assisted TanStack projects.



## Core Features


### Habit Management

- Create, edit, archive habits with name, frequency (daily / weekly / custom), and category.
- Mark habits complete per day; undo within same session.
- Streak tracking and completion rate visualization.

### Dashboard

- Today's habits at a glance (TanStack Query for real-time sync).
- Weekly/monthly heatmap (TanStack Table for data grid).
- Progress rings per habit category.

### Data & Auth

- User accounts with JWT auth.
- REST API with full OpenAPI 3.1 spec auto-generated by Cloud Agent on each merge.
- Local-first optimistic updates via TanStack Query mutations.



## Architecture

| Layer | TanStack Package | Role |
|-|--||
| Routing | TanStack Router | File-based, type-safe routes |
| Data Fetching | TanStack Query | Server state, caching, optimistic updates |
| Tables/Grids | TanStack Table | Habit history, stats views |
| Forms | TanStack Form | Habit creation/edit, validation |
